# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature addresses the synchronization issue between wallet connection and profile data in ShotCaller. Currently, users experience problems where their connected wallet doesn't properly sync with their profile information, leading to inconsistent data display and potential functionality issues. This feature will ensure seamless synchronization between wallet state, NFT collection data, and profile information.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a ShotCaller user, I want my wallet connection to automatically sync with my profile data, so that my NFT collection and user information are always up-to-date and consistent across the application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I connect my wallet THEN the system SHALL immediately fetch and sync my NFT collection data with my profile
2. WHEN my wallet connection state changes THEN the system SHALL update my profile information within 2 seconds
3. WHEN I navigate to my profile page THEN the system SHALL display the most current wallet and NFT data
4. WHEN my wallet is connected THEN the system SHALL show consistent wallet address and connection status across all components
5. WHEN I disconnect my wallet THEN the system SHALL immediately clear all profile data and return to the unauthenticated state
6. IF wallet sync fails THEN the system SHALL retry automatically up to 3 times before showing an error message

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want real-time updates of my NFT collection when my wallet data changes, so that I always see accurate information about my available moments for gameplay.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN my NFT collection changes THEN the system SHALL automatically refresh the profile display within 30 seconds
2. WHEN new NFTs are detected in my wallet THEN the system SHALL update the eligible moments count and display
3. WHEN NFTs are removed from my wallet THEN the system SHALL immediately remove them from my profile view
4. WHEN checking NFT eligibility THEN the system SHALL verify against the latest blockchain data
5. WHEN NFT data is loading THEN the system SHALL show appropriate loading states without breaking the UI
6. IF NFT data fetch fails THEN the system SHALL show cached data with a refresh option

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want my profile statistics and wallet information to stay synchronized, so that my gameplay stats accurately reflect my current wallet and NFT status.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN my wallet connects THEN the system SHALL update my profile username to reflect the wallet address format
2. WHEN calculating profile stats THEN the system SHALL use the current NFT collection count and eligibility status
3. WHEN displaying achievements THEN the system SHALL verify them against current wallet and gameplay data
4. WHEN showing collection filters THEN the system SHALL reflect the actual NFT types (NBA/NFL) in my wallet
5. WHEN profile data updates THEN the system SHALL maintain consistency between navigation components and profile page
6. IF profile sync fails THEN the system SHALL show the last known good state with a sync retry option

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want clear feedback when wallet-profile synchronization is happening, so that I understand the system status and can take appropriate action if needed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN wallet sync is in progress THEN the system SHALL show loading indicators in relevant UI components
2. WHEN sync completes successfully THEN the system SHALL provide visual confirmation of successful synchronization
3. WHEN sync encounters errors THEN the system SHALL display clear error messages with suggested actions
4. WHEN retrying sync operations THEN the system SHALL show retry progress and attempt counts
5. WHEN sync is taking longer than expected THEN the system SHALL inform the user and provide manual refresh options
6. IF sync fails permanently THEN the system SHALL offer troubleshooting steps and support contact information

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want the system to handle network issues gracefully during wallet-profile sync, so that temporary connectivity problems don't break my user experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN network connectivity is lost THEN the system SHALL show cached profile data with offline indicators
2. WHEN network connectivity returns THEN the system SHALL automatically attempt to resync wallet and profile data
3. WHEN API calls timeout THEN the system SHALL implement exponential backoff retry logic
4. WHEN blockchain queries fail THEN the system SHALL fall back to cached NFT data with appropriate warnings
5. WHEN sync operations are interrupted THEN the system SHALL resume from the last successful state
6. IF persistent network issues occur THEN the system SHALL provide offline mode functionality with limited features

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want robust error handling and logging for wallet-profile sync operations, so that I can quickly diagnose and fix synchronization issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN sync operations occur THEN the system SHALL log all wallet connection events with timestamps and user context
2. WHEN errors happen during sync THEN the system SHALL capture detailed error information including wallet type and operation context
3. WHEN retries are attempted THEN the system SHALL log retry attempts and outcomes for debugging
4. WHEN sync performance is slow THEN the system SHALL log timing metrics for optimization analysis
5. WHEN users report sync issues THEN the system SHALL provide diagnostic information to support teams
6. IF critical sync failures occur THEN the system SHALL alert administrators while maintaining user privacy

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a user with multiple wallet types, I want consistent sync behavior regardless of which wallet I use, so that my experience is uniform across different wallet providers.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using Dapper Wallet THEN the system SHALL sync NFT data using optimized Dapper-specific APIs
2. WHEN using Flow Wallet THEN the system SHALL sync using standard Flow blockchain queries
3. WHEN using other supported wallets THEN the system SHALL provide consistent sync functionality with appropriate fallbacks
4. WHEN switching between wallets THEN the system SHALL clear previous wallet data and sync new wallet information
5. WHEN wallet-specific features are available THEN the system SHALL enable them while maintaining core sync functionality
6. IF wallet-specific sync fails THEN the system SHALL fall back to generic Flow blockchain queries

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a user, I want my profile to automatically refresh when I make changes to my NFT collection outside the app, so that my ShotCaller profile stays current with my actual holdings.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I return to the app after being away THEN the system SHALL check for NFT collection changes and update accordingly
2. WHEN the app regains focus THEN the system SHALL trigger a background sync of wallet and profile data
3. WHEN I manually refresh my profile THEN the system SHALL force a complete resync of all wallet and NFT data
4. WHEN periodic sync intervals occur THEN the system SHALL automatically check for collection updates every 5 minutes
5. WHEN significant collection changes are detected THEN the system SHALL notify me of the updates
6. IF automatic sync is disabled THEN the system SHALL provide manual refresh controls with clear sync status indicators
