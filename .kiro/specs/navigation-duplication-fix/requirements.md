# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The breadcrumb navigation component is appearing multiple times on pages due to being included both in the root layout and individually on each page. This creates a poor user experience with duplicate navigation elements showing "HomeDashboardMarketplace" or similar concatenated text.

## Glossary

- **Navigation_System**: The breadcrumb navigation component that shows the user's current location in the site hierarchy
- **Root_Layout**: The main layout component that wraps all pages in the application
- **Page_Component**: Individual page components like marketplace, dashboard, profile, etc.
- **Breadcrumb_Component**: The BreadcrumbNavigation component that renders the navigation path

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user navigating the site, I want to see a single breadcrumb navigation, so that I can understand my current location without visual duplication

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Navigation_System SHALL display exactly one breadcrumb navigation per page
2. THE Navigation_System SHALL show the correct navigation path for each page
3. THE Navigation_System SHALL not display duplicate navigation elements
4. WHEN a user visits any page, THE Navigation_System SHALL show a clean, single breadcrumb trail
5. THE Navigation_System SHALL maintain consistent styling and positioning across all pages

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want breadcrumb navigation to be centrally managed, so that I don't need to include it on every individual page

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Navigation_System SHALL be included only in the root layout
2. THE Navigation_System SHALL automatically appear on all pages except the home page
3. WHEN adding new pages, THE Navigation_System SHALL not require manual inclusion of breadcrumb components
4. THE Navigation_System SHALL handle all routing and path display logic centrally
5. THE Navigation_System SHALL be easily maintainable from a single location
