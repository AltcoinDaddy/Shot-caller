# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The marketplace page is not displaying listed NFTs properly due to API response format inconsistencies and data structure mismatches between the backend services and frontend components. Users cannot see available NFTs for purchase, which breaks the core marketplace functionality.

- **Frontend_Component**: The React component that displays marketplace listings to users
